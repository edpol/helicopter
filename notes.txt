1 - Tfilte said that our client Helicopter Tours takes care of the payment 
    so the API only uses payment method 34.  
    This means we can't refund going through the API.

2 - They also said that the API cannot cancel an order, that the client has to call in.

3 - The API reponse time is slow but I don't think it's a deal breaker.
